## 🛡️ What is VALHALLA?

**VALHALLA** is not just another to-do list. It is a **gamified life-management ecosystem** designed for those who treat discipline as a battle and productivity as a conquest.

Built with the latest web technologies (**React, Vite**) and wrapped for native performance (**Electron, Capacitor**), VALHALLA runs everywhere—offline, secure, and fast. It combines a Task Manager, Habit Tracker, Gym Log, and Note-taking system into one cohesive, epic interface.

> *"Wake early. Fight hard. Die with honor."*
